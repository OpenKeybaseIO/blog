Hey, everybody, 

Following the acquisition of Keybase by Zoom, the Keybase community has clearly expressed its dissatisfaction (twitter, github, reddit and others...) with this merger. 
In particular following the numerous Zoom security flaws revealed during the "COVID-19" crisis and the massive use of videoconferencing systems. 

In short, Zoom is a digital capitalist company, and everyone knows the abuses of these companies with the use of its users' data. 

The web is dying little by little by the privatization of services, our data has become a gold mine to aggregate even more money and become the superstar of the world, which is somehow contrary to the spirit of why the Internet and the web was built ... 

In any case, I think that the open-source community can still manage to decentralize the web and the encryption of our data will become the challenge for the years to come to protect us from the freedoms that we are gradually trying to take away in our different countries!


together let's make the web of tomorrow protected.
